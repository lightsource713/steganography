## What is Steganography?  :eyes:
- Steganography is the concept of hiding information/files (text, images, documents and music) inside other files, without the other person being able to see it. It is imperceptible to the naked eye..
## Cases that used Steganography: :open_file_folder::warning:
- Hackers are using this form of steganography to hide malware inside “memes” on Twitter. Once you open the meme, it inserts malware to steal and collect your most valuable information, and then they transfer the data to a command and control server.

# Project :books::computer:
- The project was carried out for the Information Security discipline in the 1st Year of the 2nd semester, with professor Vilmar Abreu at PUC-PR.
- In the "/in" and "/out" folders I left a mini-tutorial to teach you how to use Steganography.
